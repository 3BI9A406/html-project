    <h2>WORK</h2>
    <p>Throughout my professional journey, I have gained diverse experience in various roles. I worked at Pizza Hut and McDonald's, where I developed strong customer service skills and the ability to thrive in fast-paced environments. Additionally, my experience at BSS, a call center, enhanced my communication abilities and problem-solving skills. I also worked at a clothing store, furthering my passion for fashion. Volunteering for the FIRST LEGO League robotics competition allowed me to engage with technology and teamwork. I have launched my own clothing brand, showcasing my creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. Currently, I am working on a project with Go My Code, focusing on web development and portfolio creation, which combines my skills and interests in technology and design.
